	<h1>About AppointADate</h1>

	<p>Appoint-a-Date is a web oriented scheduling system which allows users to organise appointments and provides a resource of structured information to effectively manage their business. Our system gives business owners the ability to purchase their own licensed product, from where they can then manage their staff and statistics. It offers an frontend platform for both administrative use and customer use. From their accounts, owners and staff can easily update their details. Customers have easy access to this as well as options to alter their availability and a range of other preferences. Additionally, stored information would be able to generate useful statistics based on client data.</p>

	<p>Even though appointment systems are in use in a range of other areas than just hairstyling or beauty, we decided to contain the software functionalities within a reasonable business scenario, leaving the possibility open for branching further afield at a later date. All of our implementations are made with the consideration of continued expansion to the system. Considering our inexperience yet hopeful optimism for success, the hairdressing industry seemed to be a perfect opportunity for market research and development. We decided that the most feasible choice would be to focus on this particular niche as a start.</p>

	<p>Our market research has suggested that there appears to be a number of potential competitors. We feel confident though, that our system will create a high standard of good customer service and reliable results that will put us above our rivals and set a benchmark for others to aspire to in the future.</p>
